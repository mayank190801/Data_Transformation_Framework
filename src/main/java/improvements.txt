-> try and catch is not the best way for handling errors - your software should be able to tell, what is missing as well
-> that is what we call error handling in this framework is missing for sure!!

Think about more and try to write them, make this project actually into something beneficial and problem solving
(You would always have the credits role for it)

-> One improvement could be using "String" + {} + "something" -> so that means you don't have to annoy yourself
-> if nothing is there in the entity and only StringValue is there we will take it for it's face value
-> Make a function or entity for that as well bruh!!


THINGS TO DO - (Do this asap)
-> Proper Read.me
-> Unit Testing
-> Commenting
-> All mappings example
-> Put some check on each function (No crashing happens)
